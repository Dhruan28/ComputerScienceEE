### Introduction

Image upscaling is a crucial part of modern technology and the algorithms created to generate upscaled images keep improving as we find new uses of image upscaling. The increased amount of uses for image upscaling has sparked competition between image upscaling algorithms in upscaling images efficiently.

As we displays of higher resolutions are made(4K and 8K screens), the quality of the image without upscaling appear pixelated or blurry. While rendering old/low resolution images.

Modern upscaling methods that use AI deep learning algorithms can efficiently enhance images
