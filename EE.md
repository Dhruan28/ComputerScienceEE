### Introduction

Image upscaling is a crucial part of modern technology and the algorithms created to generate upscaled images keep improving as we find new uses of image upscaling. The increased amount of uses for image upscaling has sparked competition between image upscaling algorithms in upscaling images efficiently. As displays of higher resolutions are made (4K and 8K screens), the quality of the image without upscaling appears pixelated or blurry while rendering old/low resolution images. Modern upscaling methods that use AI deep learning algorithms can efficiently enhance images.

Two prominent deep learning architectures, Fast Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (FSRCNN) and Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network (ESPCN), are highly researched image upscaling algorithms. These algorithms represent different approaches to maintaining image quality while optimizing computational resources. This investigation aims to compare FSRCNN and ESPCN in the context of upscaling digital camera images, evaluating their performance based on both output quality and processing efficiency. Understanding the relative strengths of these algorithms is essential for determining their practical applications in modern digital imaging systems.
